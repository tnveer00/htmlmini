    <p class="harry-potter-text">Joanne Rowling CH OBE FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ "rolling";[1] born 31 July 1965), better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist.</p>
    
    <p class="harry-potter-text">She wrote the magical Harry Potter series, a seven-volume fantasy journey published from 1997 to 2007. The series has enchanted readers worldwide, selling over 600 million copies, translated into 84 languages, and creating a global media phenomenon including films and video games.</p>
    
    <p class="harry-potter-text">The Casual Vacancy (2012) marked her first novel for adults, but her magical tales continue with Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, written under the alias Robert Galbraith.</p>
    
    <p class="harry-potter-text">Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling's magical journey began while working as a researcher for Amnesty International in 1990. The idea for Harry Potter was conceived during a delayed train journey from Manchester to London. Over the next seven years, she faced personal challenges, including the loss of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce, and relative poverty. However, the magical journey took flight with the publication of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, in 1997. Six enchanting sequels followed, and by 2008, Forbes had declared her the world's highest-paid author.</p>
